# Aurora-Homebrew-GUI
A (really) simple program written in Python that allows users to generate homebrew content for Aurora Builder. ___Currently only writes spells because I suck at coding.___ It'll output _spells.xml_ to whatever directory _auroraHomebrewGUI.py_ is placed in.

In the future, it'll allow you to specify a file name and output directory, but I can't be bothered right now.

Requires Python 3.11 and Tkinter.
