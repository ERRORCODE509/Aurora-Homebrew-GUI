# Aurora-Homebrew-GUI
A (really) simple program written in Python that allows users to generate homebrew content for Aurora Builder. Currently only writes spells because I suck at coding. It'll output _spells.xml_ to whatever directory _auroraHomebrewGUI.py_ is placed in.

Requires Python 3.11 and Tkinter.
