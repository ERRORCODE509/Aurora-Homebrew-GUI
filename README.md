# Aurora-Homebrew-GUI
A (really) simple program written in Python that allows users to generate homebrew content for Aurora Builder. It'll output _spells.xml_ to whatever directory is specified. Hoping to support other content types in the future.

No dependencies necessary (not even Python), just download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/ERRORCODE509/Aurora-Homebrew-GUI/releases).
